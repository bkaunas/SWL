        Throughout the summer of 2020, I carried out an independent project funded by a
        <a href="https://odoc.princeton.edu/support/martin-dale-53-summer-awards"
           target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin A. Dale Award&#8314;</a>. It
        involved design and handicraft, and it smelled strongly of red cedar. I took
        plenty of pictures and wrote a bit about it below:
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/shaving.jpg" alt="Wood Shavings" style="width: calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <p>
        The primary aim of my project was to gain the skills and knowledge required to
        timber frame competently. If you're unfamiliar with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_framing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            timber framing&#8314;
        </a>, it's a
        method of creating load-bearing structures out of wood which originated separately
        in East Asia and Western Europe thousands of years ago. It's not log cabin construction,
        nor is it stick framing; this simplified table of wood construction should help:
    </p>
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th style="border:0;"></th>
            <th>Timber Framing</th>
            <th>Log Cabin Const.</th>
            <th>Stick Framing</th>
        </tr>

    <p>
        Stick framing is the prevalent method of the modern domestic construction industry.
        It's quick, cheap, and easy. It's also boring and comparatively fragile. Log cabins are cool,
        but they're limited in terms of design. Enter timber framing: it takes
        longer, costs more (unless on-site timber is used), and requires greater skill. However,
        the final product is nothing less than robust structural sculpture.
    </p>
    <p>
        You might have seen timber framing before in gables or porch coverings appended to the newest
        Craftsman-style homes, which I think is a bit sad, but at least it looks nice. To appreciate
        the most traditional timber framed structures, you'd have to visit Japan, Britain, Germany, etc.
        In the U.S., the "really good stuff" can be found in older barns as well as in some newer barns,
        bridges, and homes designed by a small number of contemporary timber frame firms.
    </p>
    <h2  id="format">Format</h2>
    <p>
        Originally, my project was divided into five weeks of timber frame joinery workshops across
        the country and three or more weeks of renting out woodshops to further practice my skills
        and apply them in making small pieces. The pandemic ruled this plan out. My revised plan
        was to spend two weeks taking online workshops, one week practicing my skills and using
        other resources to learn further, and five or more weeks building timber framed furniture.
        All of this, of course, at home.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are few online timber framing workshops out there and ever fewer of high quality. I
        mainly used a prerecorded course offered by the Shelter Institute in Maine. I also learned
        from videos by Hisao Zen, a teacher of Japanese joinery. I used a broad variety
        of YouTube channels to further understand the techniques. Other than that, I referred to
        four excellent books on timber framing and Japanese joinery, pictured below.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/books-min.jpg" alt="Books" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <p>
        I chose to build furniture for a few reasons. Firstly, I didn't have the space for a proper
        building or other larger structure. Secondly, working at a smaller scale would make errors
        of all kinds less consequential. And thirdly, furniture would allow me to better
        experiment with different styles or configurations.
    </p>
    <h2>Materials</h2>
    <p>
        Throughout my project, I sought a compromise between productivity and depth. In terms of
        materials, maximizing productivity would mean buying pre-planed and -cut lumber; maximizing
        depth would mean chopping down trees for lumber myself. In general, I decided to buy rough-sawn
        lumber so that I could gain planing and cutting experience without taking the much greater amount
        of time required to learn felling, debarking, and adzing. I do intend to learn these skills now that
        my Dale project is officially complete, being involved enough to constitute a project in their
        own right. I will need to buy more tools, which does not disappoint me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding finishing, I decided not to use the stains or varnishes typical of woodworking. Most of
        these contain toxic chemicals and they also hide the natural appearance and texture of the wood.
        I sought to expose the wood while still protecting it. There are a number of ways to do this;
        I chose to apply pure mineral oil, then a blend of mineral oil, beeswax, and carnauba wax, both of
        which are food safe. Unnecessary, but preferable.
    </p>
    <h2>Tools</h2>
    <p>
        In the spirit of traditional timber framing, I used only simple hand tools for my project.
        Compared to using power tools, metal fasteners, and glue, my decision to use hand tools
        and joinery meant that each piece of furniture would take probably five times as long and
        involve a lot more physical effort. This may not seem worthwhile, but it made me much
        happier.

        <b><i>Marking Tools</i></b>
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/markingTools-min.jpg" alt="Marking Tools" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <ol>
        <li><i>Framing Squares:</i> for laying out joints.</li>
        <li><i>Combination Square:</i> for laying out joints, and for checking squareness and depth.</li>
        <li><i>Marking Knife:</i> for marking cut lines.</li>
        <li><i>Pencil:</i> for marking construction lines.</li>
        <li><i>Protractor:</i> for laying out joints and checking angles.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b><i>Saws</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I used Japanese pull saws rather than Western-style saws. The latter cut on the push stroke
        and provide greater power, while the former cut on the pull stroke and provide greater precision.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/saws-min.jpg" alt="Pull Saws" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <ol>
        <li><i>Timber Saw:</i> for cutting large lumber roughly and quickly.</li>
        <li><i>Crosscut Kataba:</i> for cutting protruding pegs or wedges flush to a surface.</li>
        <li><i>Crosscut Dozuki:</i> for cutting finely across the grain.</li>
        <li><i>Ryoba:</i> for cutting along <i>or</i> across the grain.</li>
        <li><i>Azebiki:</i> for starting cuts in the middle of a board.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b><i>Planing and Carving Tools</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I used Japanese kanna and a few additional tools. Compared to Western-style
        planes, which are pushed, kanna are pulled and provide greater control.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/kanna-min.jpg" alt="Kanna and Carving Tools" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <ol>
        <li><i>Drawknife:</i> for removing volume quickly or for finer carving.</li>
        <li><i>Gouge:</i> for carving depressions into lumber.</li>
        <li><i>Small Kanna:</i> for finely planing smaller surfaces.</li>
        <li>
            <i>Large Kanna:</i> for finely planing larger surfaces. To me, the most
            beautiful tool. It consists of four parts, but it is extremely precise and powerful.
        </li>
        <li><i>Mini Rabbet Plane:</i> for planing square corners.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b><i>Chisels</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I used both Japanese chisels and Western-style chisels for the project. Japanese chisels are wider, flatter, and lighter while
        Western chisels are narrower, thicker, and heavier. This makes the former better suited to softwoods and the latter
        better suited to hardwoods. Japanese chisels are also forged from a harder steel
        and laminated with an iron layer to temper the striking force and prevent chipping of the chisel edge.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/chisels-min.jpg" alt="Chisels" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <ol>
        <li><i>Oiire-Nomi Set:</i> Japanese bench chisels with many uses.</li>
        <li><i>Tsuki-Nomi:</i> Japanese slick for paring down surfaces and mortises.</li>
        <li><i>Framing Chisel:</i> for heavier duty chisel work.</li>
        <li><i>Skew Chisel Pair:</i> for finer chisel work such as cleaning up dovetails.</li>
        <li><i>Morise Chisel Set:</i> for cutting out mortises roughly and quickly.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b><i>Other Tools</i></b>
    <p>
        Besides the tools contained in the categories above, I also used the assorted but equally
        important tools pictured below.
    </p>
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/otherTools-min.jpg" alt="Other Tools" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <ol>
        <li><i>Genno:</i> for tuning kanna and compressing wood during assembly.</li>
        <li><i>Mallet:</i> for striking chisels and fitting joints.</li>
        <li><i>Clamps:</i> for securing work to the worktable.</li>
        <li><i>Brace:</i> for holding different bits and enabling drilling.</li>
        <li><i>Auger Bit:</i> for making mortises, especially peg mortises.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>
        <b><i>Sharpening Systems</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For sharpening my drawknife, kanna blades, chip breakers, and chisels, I used different systems
        in combination. Learning how to sharpen my tools well was one of the most valuable skills
        I developed throughout my project. That being said, there are degrees of sharpness that can be
        achieved with any of the tools I used and I still have much to improve upon.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/sharpeningTools-min.jpg" alt="Sharpening Tools" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <ol>
        <li><i>Sandpaper on Float Glass (240 & 400; not pictured):</i> for rougher sharpening.</li>
        <li><i>Diamond Stone (x-coarse):</i> for setting bevel angles and reflattening whetstones.</li>
        <li><i>Ceramic Whetstone (1000 & 6000):</i> for finer sharpening.</li>
        <li><i>Leather Strop & Aluminum Oxide:</i> for polishing edges.</li>
        <li><i>Honing Guide:</i> for guiding the sharpening angle.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="worktable">I: Worktable</h2>
    <p>
        The first piece of furniture I built was a worktable. This made building my later pieces much
        easier. I also knew that my first piece would not be the most polished and a rough worktable
        would be just fine.
    </p>
    <p>
        As with all of my pieces, I first made a model and an explosion in Autodesk Inventor in order
        to visualize my design and confirm dimensions as I cut everything out. For this piece in
        particular, I also carried out some statics calculations to predict the failure mode and
        load at failure. These calculations include critical assumptions, including fixed joints
        between all members, and as such are limited. However, if you're interested in them, you can
        find them <a href="TFII_Calcs.pdf" target="_blank"
                     rel="noopener noreferrer">here&#8314;</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/worktablemodel.jpg" alt="Worktable Models" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <p>
        I used wedged half-dovetail joints or <i>sage-kama</i> to connect the stretchers to the legs. To splice the tabletop boards
        together, I used an alternating variation of the shiplap joint. In my model, I connected the tabletop to the frame with
        dovetailed lap joints or <i>koshikake-ari-tsugi</i>, but when actually constructing the worktable I dropped the dovetails—the
        tabletop would not be subject to significant tension forces.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/worktableexplosion.jpg" alt="Worktable Explosion" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <p>
        I used western red cedar except for the stretchers, which are made of white pine. Western red cedar
        is one of my favorite woods to work because it has a beautiful appearance, it is soft, it is naturally insect- and rot-resistant,
        and it smells great. However, I would advise against inhaling too much of its aroma; see <a href="wrca.pdf"
                                                                                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this&#8314;</a> occupational hazard named after the species. It is also laden with knots.

    <p>
        The first step was to cut the members to length.

    <img src="img/nick/worktable2-min.JPG" alt="Worktable Construction" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">
    <p>
        I then planed them. Wood shavings are beautiful.

    <p>
        My first tenons—those at either end of the stretchers—where imperfect, but they were good enough.
    </p>
    <img src="img/nick/worktable6-min.JPG" alt="Worktable Construction" style="width:calc(180px + 40vw);">

        The same goes for my first mortises. They look great from afar and are sized well, but closer inspection reveals a bit of roughness.

        While the cracks running along a couple of the legs may appear worrisome, their structural effect is, in this case, negligible. Actually,
        I'm a fan of the look; it's more honest.

    <h2 id="coffeetable">II: Coffee Table</h2>
    <p>
        My second piece was a coffee table. This time I used a combination of western red cedar and douglas fir/larch and a sheet of tempered glass
        to complete the tabletop. I used open slot mortises or <i>sammai-gumi</i> to connect the outer top frame; however, in order to attach the legs,
        I cut an additional through-mortise in each one of these joints. The inner diamond frame is connected at the ends with lap joints which are
        housed in side-mortises.

        After roughly completing the short ends of the outer frame, my kanna blades and chip breaker were due for a good sharpening. This took
        most of the day.

        The picture below only begins to demonstrate the difficulty of fitting the frames together squarely. I think I cut the joints
        too tightly at first... Getting the leg tenons through each of the through-mortises in the frame was a real challenge.

    <h2 id="waterstone">III: Waterstone Holder</h2>
    <p>
        After the coffee table, I made a smaller, non-furniture piece. It was a portable holder for my sharpening stones, which would not only enable
        me to sharpen above a tub of water but also provide more stability during sharpening. Beyond that, the point of creating this piece was to try
        a more complex joint and to work with hardwood rather than softwood. In particular, the piece uses the mortised rabbeted oblique scarf joint,
        or <i>kanawa-tsugi</i>, and is made out of red oak.

        My fourth and final piece was a desk or table. For this, I sought to incorporate two special timber frame techniques: the pegged brace and
        the tusked tenon. This piece exclusively used western red cedar.

        I only got this far with the desk. It turned out that I made the strecher a couple inches too long, so the tabletop boards wouldn't
        fit. This would have been an easy fix; unfortunately, I would be leaving home the next day and had to finish packing, so it didn't happen.

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Over the course of my Dale project, I developed a much greater understanding of, and
        appreciation for, the work of timber framers. My cutting of joints improved greatly
        with each piece constructed but I feel that this marks only the beginning
        of my development as a timber frame craftsman. This ten-week base of knowledge
        and practice will, I think, serve to orient a much longer process of learning. In the
        decades to come, I hope to continue improving and refining the techniques of this
        wonderful craft. Finally, I would like to thank the Dale Family, whose great generosity
        enabled this transformative project in the first place.
